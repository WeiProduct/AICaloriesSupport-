# GitHub Pages Support Website Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup Instructions

I've created a complete support website for your AI Calorie app. Here's how to deploy it:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

2. Click the **"+"** icon (top right) ‚Üí **"New repository"**
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name:** `ai-calories-support`
   - **Visibility:** Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **DON'T** initialize with README
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push the Support Website

Open Terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/weifu/Desktop/AIÂç°Ë∑ØÈáå

# Initialize git for the docs folder
cd docs
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial support website for AI Calorie app"

# Add your repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-calories-support.git

```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

4. Configure:

git commit -m "Add app icon"
git push
```

### Step 6: Update App Store Connect
