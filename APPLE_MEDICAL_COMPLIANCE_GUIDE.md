# Apple App Store Medical Information Compliance Guide

## üö® Issue: Guideline 1.4.1 - Safety - Physical Harm

Apple rejected the app because it includes medical/nutritional information without proper citations.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

I've added comprehensive medical disclaimers and citations throughout the app to comply with Apple's guidelines:

### 1. **Medical Disclaimer Screen**
- **Location**: Shows after language selection on first launch
- **Access**: Settings > About > Health Disclaimer
- **Features**:
  - Clear medical disclaimer text
  - Links to authoritative sources
  - User must accept before using the app
  - Persistent access from settings

### 2. **Citation Sources Added**
The app now references these authoritative sources:
- **USDA FoodData Central** - Primary nutrition data source
- **WHO Healthy Diet Guidelines** - International dietary standards
- **Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)** - Nutrient recommendations
- **CDC Nutrition Guidelines** - Public health recommendations

### 3. **Citations Throughout the App**
- **Daily Summary View**: Footer with "Data Sources" link
- **Food Recognition Results**: Compact citation link under results
- **Settings**: Dedicated "Health Disclaimer" section

### 4. **Onboarding Flow Updated**
New user flow:
1. Language Selection
2. **Medical Disclaimer (NEW)** - Must accept to continue
3. Goal Selection
4. Profile Setup
5. Main App

## üì± Testing the Implementation

1. **Clean Install Test**:
   ```bash
   # Delete app from simulator/device
   # Reinstall and verify disclaimer shows after language selection
   ```

2. **Verify Citations Appear**:
   - Open camera and take food photo
   - Check for "Data Sources" link in results
   - Tap link to view full citations

3. **Settings Access**:
   - Go to Profile/Settings tab
   - Look for "Health Disclaimer" with shield icon
   - Verify it opens citation view

## üìã Resubmission Checklist

When resubmitting to Apple:

### 1. **Update App Description**
Add to your App Store description:
```

```

### 2. **Screenshots**
Include at least one screenshot showing:
